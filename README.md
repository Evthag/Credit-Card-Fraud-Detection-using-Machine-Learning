### Project Title

**Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning**

### Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that accurately identifies suspicious activities while minimizing false alarms. The dataset used contains anonymized transaction features and a binary target indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

Detecting fraud is crucial for financial institutions to prevent losses and ensure trust in digital payments.

### Tech Stack / Tools

* **Languages:** Python
* **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, imbalanced-learn
* **Techniques:** Data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation

### Workflow 

1. Data loading and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
2. Handling class imbalance
3. Feature scaling and transformation
4. Model training 
5. Model evaluation using metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
6. Model interpretation
